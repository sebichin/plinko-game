# 🎮 Plinko Game

A modern, interactive Plinko game simulator built with vanilla JavaScript and Matter.js physics engine. Experience the thrill of the classic Plinko game with smooth physics, customizable settings, and an intuitive interface.

## 🎯 Features

- **Advanced Custom Physics Engine**: 
  - Semi-Implicit Euler integration for stable, energy-conserving simulation
  - Fixed timestep accumulator for deterministic physics across all devices
  - Impulse-based collision resolution for realistic interactions
  - Spatial hashing for efficient O(N) collision detection
- **Realistic Physics**: Precisely tuned material properties (gravity, friction, restitution)
- **Customizable Gameplay**: 
  - Choose between 8, 12, or 16 rows for different difficulty levels
  - Adjustable ball size (5% - 45%)
  - Variable betting amounts
- **Auto-Play Mode**: Hold the button to automatically drop balls at speeds up to 20 balls per second
- **Multiplier System**: Land in different buckets for various multiplier payouts (up to 1000x!)
- **Sound Effects**: Dynamic audio feedback for peg hits and winning scores
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices with touch support
- **Modern UI**: Clean, dark-themed interface built with Tailwind CSS

## 🎲 How to Play

1. **Set Your Bet**: Enter the amount you want to wager (default: $100)
2. **Choose Difficulty**: Select 8, 12, or 16 rows to adjust the challenge level
3. **Adjust Settings**: 
   - Use the Auto Speed slider to control how fast balls drop in auto-play mode
   - Adjust Ball Size to change the ball diameter
4. **Drop Balls**: 
   - Click once to drop a single ball
   - Hold the button to enable auto-play mode
5. **Watch and Win**: Watch your ball bounce through the pegs and land in a multiplier bucket!

## 💰 Multipliers

Different row configurations offer unique multiplier distributions:

- **8 Rows**: 29x, 4x, 2x, 0.3x, 2x, 4x, 29x
- **12 Rows**: 170x, 24x, 8.1x, 2x, 1x, 0.5x, 1x, 2x, 8.1x, 24x, 170x
- **16 Rows**: 1000x, 26x, 9x, 4x, 2x, 0.2x, 0.2x, 0.2x, 0.2x, 0.2x, 2x, 4x, 9x, 26x, 1000x

Higher risk = higher potential rewards!

## 📦 Installation

No build process required! Simply:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sebichin/plinko-game.git
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your web browser:
   ```bash
   cd plinko-game
   open index.html
   ```

Or use a local web server:
```bash
# Using Python
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js (http-server)
npx http-server
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## 🌐 Hosting on GitHub Pages

This project is configured to deploy automatically to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions. The workflow:

1. Triggers on pushes to the `main` branch
2. Deploys the `index.html` file to GitHub Pages
3. Makes the game accessible at `https://sebichin.github.io/plinko-game/`

### Manual GitHub Pages Setup

If you want to set up GitHub Pages manually:

1. Go to your repository settings
2. Navigate to "Pages" in the sidebar
3. Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"
4. The game will be automatically deployed on the next push

## 🎨 Customization

The game is highly customizable. Here are some areas you can modify:

### Physics Engine

The game uses a custom-built physics engine implementing advanced computational dynamics. For detailed information about the implementation, see [PHYSICS_IMPLEMENTATION.md](PHYSICS_IMPLEMENTATION.md).

Key features:
- **Semi-Implicit Euler Integration**: Energy-conserving symplectic integrator
- **Fixed Timestep**: Deterministic physics (1/60 second steps)
- **Impulse-Based Collisions**: Realistic momentum transfer
- **Spatial Hashing**: Efficient O(N) collision detection

### Adjust Physics
Edit the physics constants in the JavaScript:
```javascript
// In physics-engine.js
engine = new PhysicsEngine({ gravity: 0.98 });  // Gravity strength

// In RigidBody constructor
restitution: 0.7,  // Bounciness (0-1)
friction: 0.08,    // Surface friction
```

### Change Multipliers
Modify the `MULTIPLIERS` object:
```javascript
const MULTIPLIERS = {
    8:  [29, 4, 2, 0.3, 2, 4, 29],
    12: [170, 24, 8.1, 2, 1, 0.5, 1, 2, 8.1, 24, 170],
    16: [1000, 26, 9, 4, 2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 2, 4, 9, 26, 1000]
};
```

### Customize Colors
Update the color scheme in the CSS or JavaScript render options:
```javascript
render: { 
    fillStyle: '#ff0055',      // Ball color
    strokeStyle: '#ff88aa',    // Ball outline
    lineWidth: 2
}
```
